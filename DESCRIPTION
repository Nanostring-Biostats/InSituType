Description: Insitutype is an algorithm for performing cell typing in single cell 
             spatial transcriptomics data, such as is generated by the CosMx platform. 
             It can perform supervised cell typing from reference profiles, unsupervised clustering,
             or semi-supervised cell typing in which cells both reference cell types and de novo
             clusters are fit.
